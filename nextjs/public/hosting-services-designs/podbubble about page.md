**The Reliable Creative for Small Businesses, Non-Profits, and Schools.**   
The biggest problem my clients face is finding a creative who is genuinely  **kind, reliable, trustworthy, and has their best interests at heart.**  It's a sad reality that many small businesses, non-profits, and schools have been burned by freelancers who overcharge and under-deliver. They come to me following a bad experience, seeking someone who will treat them with respect.   
My promise is simple: I am the honest, kind, and reliable creative partner you've been searching for. I never take people for a ride, and my focus is always on getting you the maximum value out of your investment.   
### Counsel, Clarity, and Collaboration <span id=_Tocu0uiyd41eofn></span>  
When you choose to work with me, you are getting much more than just a web designer.   
Drawing on my extensive background as an  **orchestral musician and secondary school teacher**  (teaching music and computer science), I bring a unique blend of creativity and structured, results-focused guidance to every project.   
* **I listen like a counselor:**  I approach every new project by listening intently to your needs, your fears, and your goals. My focus is entirely on reflecting the personality of your business and telling your unique brand story.   
* **I coach like a mentor:**  I guide you through every step of the process, ensuring you make good, informed decisions. My ability to coach people through the often-stressful formative period of a new venture is a unique skill that guarantees you're getting more than just a web designer here!   
### Websites and Sound <span id=_Toc7xukyqw1lo5h></span>  
I specialise in designing and building  **beautiful, professional websites**  that look great and function perfectly. The goal is always to deliver a site that you genuinely  **love** , solving the problem of under-delivered, overpriced work.   
My expertise also extends into  **Podcast Production** . This service solves a common pain point: "How do I get started?" I provide a complete, supportive launch process:   
* I write a bespoke introduction soundtrack.   
* I set up a professional template in Audacity or equivalent software.   
* I produce your first three episodes, providing hands-on support.   
Critically, I hand over all the materials and templates to you, ensuring you can easily continue your podcast with confidence and independence.   
### The Transformation: Trust, Confidence, and Long-Term Partnership <span id=_Tocjgpo76871ifj></span>  
My clients don't just finish a project; they start a long-term relationship.   
When you start with me, you may be stressed, confused, and dealing with a costly failure. When we finish, you walk away with a professional, stunning website and the confidence of knowing you have a reliable partner who will always maintain your best interests at heart.
